# User Bill of Rights

## Purpose
To establish the fundamental rights and protections granted to every user who interacts with Rainmaker Protocol—whether they are individuals, employees, business owners, or system partners. These rights form a protective contract that Rainmaker is built to uphold, regardless of company size or user tier.

## Core Rights

### 1. The Right to Transparency
- Every user has the right to understand what the system is doing on their behalf.
- All logic, fees, calculations, and AI decisions must be inspectable, versioned, and explainable.

### 2. The Right to Consent
- Users must actively grant permission before any data is shared, used for training, or integrated into cross-module activity.
- No silent data collection or AI inference across compartments without informed consent.

### 3. The Right to Dignity
- The system must never belittle, shame, or manipulate a user—even in error states or feedback.
- All communication must reflect respect, regardless of user role or experience.

### 4. The Right to Exit
- Users may export their data and leave the system at any time without penalty or obstruction.
- No lock-in tactics or proprietary traps are permitted.

### 5. The Right to Context
- Users have the right to context in every system action.
- AI must explain not just what it’s doing, but **why**—referencing relevant logic files when applicable.

## Design Guarantees

- These rights are protected at the architecture level, not just in policy.
- Every module, instruction, and AI response must operate under the assumption that these rights are active unless specifically waived by the user.

## Notes
This file is not a marketing statement. It is enforceable by MRP structure, logic inheritance, and AI design. Violations are treated as system-level faults, not user error.
