# Compartment Definitions

## Purpose
To define the six foundational compartments of Rainmaker Protocol. These compartments form the structural and operational heart of the system and must be maintained, developed, and extended according to modular integrity standards.

## The Six Core Compartments

### 1. Scheduling & Calendar
- Centralizes time-sensitive operations
- Powers installation calendars, smart booking, AI-optimized workflows
- Connected to internal capacity forecasting and customer notifications

### 2. Financial Tools
- Includes invoicing, pricing models, revenue share distribution, and tax simulations
- Future integration with real-time financial tracking and decentralized accounting

### 3. Labor & Time Tracking
- Syncs employee clock-ins, project costing, and incentive tracking
- Tied to AI-generated payroll logic and job-level reporting
- Includes Raspberry Pi key fob systems and time-to-pay visualizations

### 4. CRM & Relationship Management
- Contact and project tracking across customer, vendor, and partner relationships
- Connected to behavior tagging, referrals, communication logs, and AI summaries

### 5. AI Instruction & Behavior Layer
- The Jarvis layer interprets stored logic, user prompts, and internal states
- Learns over time via MRP amendments and file-based instruction stacking

### 6. Governance & Permissions
- Controls system access, role-based interaction, and shareholder decisions
- Will evolve into a smart contract and blockchain-compatible model
- Interfaces with CapGov, voting protocols, and amendment acknowledgments

## Notes
These compartments are logically and functionally separated. Interactions between them are governed by protocols defined in `System_Modularity_Principles.md` and any active amendments.

Future compartments must be proposed as extensions, not replacements.
