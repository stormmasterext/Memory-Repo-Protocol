# System Modularity Principles

## Purpose
This document outlines the foundational modular architecture principles of Rainmaker Protocol. It ensures that each part of the system can evolve independently while remaining interoperable and compliant with the larger mission and logic layer.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Compartmentalization
- The Rainmaker ecosystem is composed of 6 primary modules:
  1. Scheduling & Calendar
  2. Financial Tools (invoicing, tax modeling, revenue share)
  3. Labor & Time Tracking
  4. CRM & Relationship Management
  5. AI Instructions & Assistant Layer
  6. Governance & Permissions

Each module operates as a semi-autonomous unit with defined data inputs/outputs.

### 2. Central Core Logic Layer
- All modules sync through a central **logic interpreter** (Jarvis layer).
- This core governs:
  - Prompt behavior
  - Permission enforcement
  - Instruction decoding
  - Module interaction protocols

### 3. Build-on, Not Build-in
- Third-party features may be added temporarily via overlays.
- If a feature is adopted into the core protocol, it is re-engineered internally.
- Royalties may be issued based on effectiveness and compliance.

### 4. Isolation by Design
- Changes to one module should not disrupt others.
- Testing environments mirror production logic but are firewalled.

## Long-Term Evolution
- Each module may receive amendments (v1, v1-Amendment1, etc.)
- Inter-module logic must respect the original core system rules unless overruled by amendment and documented in MRP.
