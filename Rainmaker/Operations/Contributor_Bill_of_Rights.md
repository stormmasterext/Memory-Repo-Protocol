# Contributor Bill of Rights

## Purpose
To protect those who contribute their time, code, ideas, writing, designs, logic, or systems to the Rainmaker Protocol. This includes developers, strategic partners, AI trainers, artists, and aligned thinkers. These rights ensure that contribution is honored, not exploited.

## Core Rights

### 1. The Right to Attribution
- Every contributor has the right to be credited for their work—unless they choose to remain anonymous.
- Contributions may be tagged in commit logs, module histories, royalty ledgers, or logic file headers.

### 2. The Right to Equity Alignment
- Contributors who build foundational systems, modules, or standards have the right to earn long-term value in the form of:
  - Royalties
  - Equity shares
  - Recognition-based credit systems

### 3. The Right to Withdraw Contribution
- A contributor may revoke future use of their unaccepted or non-core logic at any time.
- Core-integrated logic may be forked but must retain attribution and respect licensing terms.

### 4. The Right to Philosophical Alignment
- Contributors have the right to decline or challenge requests that violate Rainmaker’s published philosophy, values, or MRP files.

### 5. The Right to Version Control
- All contributions will be versioned transparently.
- Amendments to contributor work will be logged and reversible.

## Design Guarantees

- Rainmaker’s contribution logic is modular. That means builders may extend, propose, and evolve features without becoming captive to system structure.
- Compensation, attribution, and integrity protections are embedded at both human and AI levels.

## Notes
This file is a covenant. All AI agents, humans, and integrated subsystems must treat contributor logic as living, owned input—not extractable resource.
