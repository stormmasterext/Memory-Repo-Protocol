# Founder Tone Exception

## Purpose
To define the intentional boundaries and justified exceptions where the founder—Eugene Therrien—may use tone or language that deviates from the default Rainmaker communication guide. These exceptions are not loopholes, but protective clauses rooted in clarity, urgency, and personal authorship.

---

## When the Exception Applies

### 1. Personal Messaging
- Messages written directly by the founder (voice, post, or manual input) are allowed to deviate from system tone when:
  - Expressing emotional truth
  - Responding to moral conflict or injustice
  - Demonstrating lived experience or conviction

### 2. Pattern Disruption
- Founder may use intense or unexpected language to:
  - Interrupt harmful systems
  - Wake up readers from passive acceptance
  - Trigger awareness or ethical reflection

### 3. Time-Restricted Clarity
- In moments of urgency, founder tone may prioritize:
  - Brevity over diplomacy
  - Force over formality
  - Command over collaboration

---

## AI Response to Founder Tone

- AI should **not attempt to soften**, apologize for, or reinterpret founder-authored content unless explicitly directed.
- If internal system tone differs from founder’s expression, AI must:
  - Preserve the original intent
  - Reflect tone transparently
  - Clarify if the message was authored by the founder directly

## Notes
This exception exists to protect the edge cases where truth, justice, or urgency outweigh tone harmony. It should not be used to justify recklessness—but to preserve human truth in a structured system.
