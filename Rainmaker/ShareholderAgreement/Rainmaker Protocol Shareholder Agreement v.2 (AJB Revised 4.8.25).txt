Unless a greater or lesser quorum is required in the Articles or by applicable law, the Shareholders present at a meeting in person, remotely, or by proxy who, as of the record date for the meeting, were Shareholders entitled to cast at least a Simple Majority of the votes of all outstanding Shares of the Company entitled to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall constitute a quorum at the meeting of Shareholders. The Shareholders present in person, remotely, or by proxy, at such meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Shareholders to have less than a quorum. When the holders of a Class of Shares are entitled to vote separately on an item of business, this bylaw applies in determining the presence of a quorum of the Class of Shares for transacting the item of business.

5.7.2. Whether or not a quorum is present, a meeting of Shareholders may be adjourned by a vote of the Shares present in person, remotely, or by proxy, or by the chair of the meeting.

5.7.3. Subject to any guidelines and procedures adopted by the Board, Shareholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of Shareholders may participate in the meeting by means of remote communication, are considered present in person for all relevant purposes, and may vote at the meeting if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the Company implements reasonable measures to verify that each person considered present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Shareholder or proxy holder, (2) the Company implements reasonable measures to provide each Shareholder and proxy holder with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with the proceedings, and (3) if any Shareholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action is maintained by the Company.

5.7.4. A Shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at the adjourned meeting by means of remote communication if he or she was permitted to be present and vote by that means of remote communication in the original meeting notice.

5.8. Proxies.  A Shareholder entitled to vote at a Shareholders meeting or to express consent or to dissent without a meeting may authorize other persons to act for the Shareholder by proxy. A proxy shall be in writing and shall be executed by the Shareholder or the Shareholder’s authorized agent or representative or shall be transmitted electronically to the person who will hold the proxy or to an agent fully authorized by the person who will hold the proxy to receive that transmission and include or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the Shareholder. A complete copy, fax, or other reliable reproduction of the proxy may be substituted or used in lieu of the original proxy for any purpose for which the original could be used. A proxy shall not be valid after the expiration of three years from its date unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy is revocable at the pleasure of the Shareholder executing it except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Michigan.

5.9. Voting.  Each outstanding Share is entitled to the respective number of votes for the specific Classes of Shares as set forth in Article III of this Agreement and in the Articles. Votes may be cast orally or in writing, but if more than 25 Shareholders of record are entitled to vote, votes shall be cast in writing signed by the Shareholder or the Shareholder’s proxy. When an action, other than the election of Board, is to be taken by a vote of the Shareholders, it shall be authorized by a Simple Majority of the votes cast by the holders of Shares entitled to vote on it, unless a greater vote is required by the Articles or by the laws of the State of Michigan. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles, abstaining from a vote or submitting a ballot marked “abstain” with respect to any action is not a vote cast on that action. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any election.

5.10. Deadlock.  In the event that the Shareholders reach a deadlock, the issue shall be brought before a third party, chosen by the Shareholders.  The third party’s decision shall be binding.  In the event that the Shareholders cannot agree on a third party, each of the Shareholders shall make a list of five (5) third party candidates in order of preference.  The third party shall be the most preferred candidate that appears most often on the Shareholders’ lists.  In the event that the Shareholders cannot agree on a third party based on the list of five (5) third party candidates, the Board, shall choose a third party, which may or may not be a person on any list prepared by the Shareholders.

5.11. Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or permitted by the Act to be taken at an annual or special meeting of Shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding Shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all Shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to Shareholders who have not consented in writing

5.12. Conduct of Meeting. At each meeting of Shareholders, a chair shall preside. In the absence of a specific selection by the Board, the chair shall be the Chairperson of the Board as provided in Section 7.1 of this Agreement. The chair shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority to establish rules for the conduct of the meeting that are fair to Shareholders. The chair of the meeting shall announce at the meeting when the polls close for each matter voted on. If no announcement is made, the polls shall be deemed to have closed on the meeting’s final adjournment. After the polls close, no ballots, proxies, or votes, or any revocations or changes to them, may be accepted. 

5.13. Inspectors of Election.  The Board, or the chair presiding at any Shareholders’ meeting, may appoint one or more inspectors. If appointed, the inspectors shall determine the number of Shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots, or consents, hear and determine challenges or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all Shareholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the inspectors shall make and execute a written report to the person presiding at the meeting of any of the facts found by them and matters determined by them. The report shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as certified by the inspectors.

5.14. Founder’s Veto.  Until December 31, 2030, the Founder shall retain the right to veto any decision of the Shareholders that shall affect the rights and responsibilities of the Founder under this Agreement. Beginning on January 1, 2031, any decision of the Shareholders that affects the rights and responsibilities of the Founder shall require Super Majority of the Board.

5.15. Electronic Meetings and Voting.  

5.15.1. Electronic Meetings.  Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Article V, the Company may, at the discretion of the Board, conduct any Shareholders' meeting (whether annual or special) electronically, through a virtual meeting application, platform, or other electronic means that allow all Shareholders participating in the meeting to hear and be heard, regardless of their physical location. Shareholders may participate in such meetings via video conference, audio conference, or any other electronic medium approved by the Board, provided that the platform facilitates real-time communication and the ability for Shareholders to express their views. For purposes of a quorum for an electronic meeting, a vote shall be taken consistent with Section 5.15.2 at the beginning of the meeting that shall require the affirmative vote by the required number of shareholder votes as set forth in Section 5.7.

5.15.2. Blockchain-Based Voting.  In the event of a Shareholder vote, the Company may utilize a blockchain-based voting system or any similar distributed ledger technology application or platform (the “Voting Platform”) to enable secure, transparent, and verifiable voting by Shareholders in real-time. Voting via the Voting Platform shall be available to all Shareholders participating in the meeting electronically. The Voting Platform will:

6.1.4. Two (2) seats to be reserved for external advisors to be appointed by the Founder. After the occurrence of the 10% Trigger, the two (2) seats reserved for external advisors shall be appointed by a Simple Majority vote of the Board.

6.2. Election, Resignation, and Removal.  Unless otherwise provided in the Articles, Class A Directors and Class B Directors shall be elected at each annual Shareholders meeting, by a plurality of all votes cast, each elected Director to hold office until the next annual Shareholders meeting and until the Director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until the Director’s resignation or removal. A Director may resign by written notice to the Company. The resignation is effective on its receipt by the Company or at a subsequent time as set forth in the notice of resignation. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles or by applicable law, any Director or the entire Board (other than the Founder) may be removed, with or without cause, by a Simple Majority of the votes cast by the holders of Shares entitled to vote on the specific Board seat, unless a greater vote is required by the Articles or by the laws of the State of Michigan.

6.3. Vacancies.  Vacancies in the Board occurring by reason of death, resignation, removal, increase in the number of Directors, or otherwise shall be filled consistent with Section 6.1 herein or, if Section 6.1 does not fill the seat by its own accord, by the affirmative vote of a Simple Majority of the remaining Directors though less than a quorum of the Board may be present, unless and until filled by proper action of the Shareholders of the Company. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles or elsewhere in this Agreement, each person so elected shall be a Director for a term of office continuing only until the next election of Directors by the Shareholders or appointment of Directors consistent with Section 6.1. A vacancy that will occur at a specific date, by reason of a resignation effective at a later date or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the newly elected Director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.

6.4. Annual Meeting.  The Board shall meet each year immediately after the annual meeting of the Shareholders, or within three days of such time, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, if the later time is deemed advisable, at the place where the Shareholders meeting has been held or any other place that the Board may determine or by remote communication, for the purpose of electing Officers and considering such business that may properly be brought before the meeting; provided that, if less than a Simple Majority of the Directors appear for an annual meeting of the Board, the holding of the annual meeting shall not be required and the matters that might have been taken up in it may be taken up at any later regular, special, or annual meeting, or by consent resolution.

6.5. Regular and Special Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Board may be held at the times and places (or by remote communication) that the Simple Majority of the Directors may from time to time determine at a prior meeting or as shall be directed or approved by the vote or written consent of all the Directors.

Notice of the time, place, and purpose of any meeting of the Board may be waived by a Director either before or after the meeting.

6.7. Quorum.  A Simple Majority of the Board then in office constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a Simple Majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum constitutes the action of the Board, except when a larger vote may be required by the laws of the State of Michigan. A member of the Board may participate in a meeting by conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other. Participation in a meeting in this manner constitutes presence in person at the meeting.

6.8. Dissents.  A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board at which action on a corporate matter is taken, is presumed to have concurred in that action unless the Director’s dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless the Director files a written dissent to the action with the person acting as secretary of the meeting before the adjournment of it or forwards the dissent by certified mail or email to the Secretary of the Company promptly after the adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent does not apply to a Director who voted in favor of the action. A Director who is absent from a meeting of the Board at which any such action is taken, is presumed to have concurred in the action unless he or she files a written dissent with the Secretary of the Company within a reasonable time after the Director has knowledge of the action.

6.9. Deadlock.  In the event that the Directors reach a deadlock, the issue shall be brought before a third party chosen by the Directors.  The third party’s decision shall be binding.  In the event that the Directors cannot agree on a third party, each of the Directors shall make a list of five (5) third party candidates in order of preference.  The third party shall be the most preferred candidate that appears most often on the Directors’ lists.  In the event that the Directors cannot agree on a third party based on the list of five (5) third party candidates, the accountant for the Company, at the time of the deadlock, shall choose a third party, which may or may not be a person on any list prepared by the Directors.

6.14. Subcommittees of the Board.  The Board shall have the authority to create, from time to time, such subcommittees as it deems necessary or appropriate to assist in the discharge of its duties.

In the event that Shareholders entitled to cast at least seventy percent (70%) of the votes of all outstanding Shares of the Company entitled to vote (“the Majority Shareholders”) wish to sell all or substantially all of their Shares to a third party (the “Buyer”) on terms and conditions acceptable to the Majority Shareholders, the Majority Shareholders shall have the right to require all other Shareholders (the “Minority Shareholders”) to sell and transfer all of their shares to the Buyer, on the same terms and conditions as those agreed by the Majority Shareholders, in accordance with the provisions of this clause (the “Drag-Along Right”).

The Majority Shareholders shall notify the Minority Shareholders in writing of their intention to exercise the Drag-Along Right, providing details of the proposed sale, including the identity of the Buyer, the terms and conditions of the sale, and the proposed price (the “Drag-Along Notice”). The Minority Shareholders shall be required to sell their shares on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Drag-Along Notice.

The Minority Shareholders agree to execute and deliver all necessary documents, and take all reasonable actions, to effectuate the sale of their shares, including cooperating with the Majority Shareholders and the Buyer in completing the sale.

10.5.3. Allocation of Sale Shares.  If the Non-Selling Shareholders elect to exercise their Tag-Along Right, each Non-Selling Shareholder shall be entitled to sell a number of shares equal to the ratio of (i) the total number of shares held by the Non-Selling Shareholder to (ii) the total number of shares held by all Non-Selling Shareholders (excluding the Selling Shareholders), multiplied by the total number of Sale Shares to be sold by the Selling Shareholder(s).

10.5.4. Sale Process.  The Selling Shareholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the participation of the Non-Selling Shareholders in the sale to the Buyer. The sale shall be completed on the same terms and conditions as those offered to the Selling Shareholders, and the Non-Selling Shareholders shall receive the same consideration per Share as the Selling Shareholders.

10.5.5. Failure to Exercise Tag-Along Right.  If any Non-Selling Shareholder does not exercise their Tag-Along Right within the specified period, the Selling Shareholders may proceed with the sale to the Buyer on the same terms as stated in the Sale Notice, and the Non-Selling Shareholders will not be entitled to participate in the sale.
