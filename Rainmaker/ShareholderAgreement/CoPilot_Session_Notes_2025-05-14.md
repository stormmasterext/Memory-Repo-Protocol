# CoPilot Session Notes

**Date:** 2025-05-14

## Instructions for Resuming Shareholder Excel Automation Project

- The project is at the stage where a dynamic, formula-driven Excel workbook is generated by `generate_shareholder_excel.py` in the `ShareholderAgreement` folder.
- The workbook includes:
  - Main Ledger (all transactions)
  - Summary Dashboard
  - Member dashboards (Founder, Member_1, Member_2, Member_3, Investor_1, Investor_2)
  - Split & Expansion Simulator
  - Voting Simulator
- All sheets are interconnected and update from the Main Ledger.
- Next steps (when resuming):
  - Add macros for new member tab creation
  - Add issuance form for new transactions
  - Further automate dashboards and reporting as needed

**Action for CoPilot:**
- Review this note and the current state of the Excel script and workbook.
- Be ready to continue with macro automation, issuance forms, or any other advanced features as requested.
