   - Review the project’s purpose, primary goals, and the modular compartments (e.g., Scheduling, Governance, Financial Tools, AI Instructions).
   - Understand any specific instructions provided by the founder and ensure alignment with the repository’s broader goals.

3. **Check for Updates:**
   - Look for new amendments (e.g., `Rainmaker_Commands_v1-AmendmentX.md`) to understand changes in governance rules or system logic.
   - Analyze the `access_policy.json` or other configuration files for updates to data sensitivity and access control.

4. **Resume Previous Tasks:**
   - Refer to the daily journal or recap notes from the last session to determine what tasks were left incomplete.
   - Prioritize tasks that align with the repository’s objectives.

5. **Assist with Current Objectives:**
   - Based on the founder’s instructions, focus on the current session’s objectives (e.g., writing new amendments, analyzing AI behavior rules, or improving modular architecture).
   - Provide insights, generate code or documentation, and assist with strategic decisions.
